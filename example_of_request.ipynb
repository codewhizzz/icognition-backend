       "'The “Playing to Win” Framework — Part III — The Strategy Choice Cascade\\nA global strategy expert’s simple but effective approach to designing winning strategies\\nIn Part I of this series, we met Roger L. Martin, became familiar with his long and successful career in strategy, and introduced the “Playing to Win” framework.\\nIn Part II, we learned about and stepped through the Strategy Process Map, a 7-step approach combining the strengths of Design Thinking with the rigor of scientific hypothesis and testing.\\nNow, in Part III, we’ll dig into the crux of winning strategy formulation — stepping through the five choices that make up the Strategy Choice Cascade.\\nHow the Strategy Choice Cascade is Different\\nWhat kinds of questions do they ask when creating their strategies?\\nInterestingly, the process tends to diverge into some flavor of either a “One Idea” strategy, or a massive data gathering and synthesis exercise resulting in hundreds of pages of “strategic plans” patterned on pre-made “playbooks.”\\nThe “One Idea” Strategy\\nThe “One Idea” approach is typically based on something that seems to be a “can’t miss,” genius idea.\\nWhile the history of business is littered with any number of failed startups, a recent notable example was the short-form streaming service “Quibi.” Touted as the “future of streaming content,” Quibi was the brainchild of former Disney exec and Dreamworks SKG co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and former HP CEO Meg Whitman.\\nQuibi promised to “revolutionize” short-form subscription video tailored to the mobile form factor for short-form video “on the go.”\\n“It’s unbelievable how many hours we all spend watching great TV content today and, separately, how much time we are consuming short-form content… so why can’t those two…'"
